    I'm a Backend-focused Software Engineer passionate about building
    cloud-native, resilient, and observable distributed systems. I specialize in
    <strong>Golang</strong>, and bring additional experience with <strong>Node.js</strong> and
    <strong>Python</strong>. I'm well-versed in containerized deployments using
    <strong>Docker</strong>, and leverage observability tools like <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong>,
    <strong>Grafana</strong>, and <strong>Prometheus</strong> to maintain system reliability.

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
    I care deeply about interoperable systems, clean architecture, and bringing
    clarity to complex backend challenges. Always learning, always improving â€”
    and always looking to build meaningful technology that scales.
